### About Me 😄

I've been at IBM since September 2018 as a software developer, after graduating with a master's in physics from Durham University.

From the 12th October I will be joining Thought Machine as a backend engineer, working on their cloud-native core banking platform.

### Skills 🧰

I am most experienced with JavaScript, Python and Go as languages.

I've experience in front-end development, with React as my main framework.

I enjoy algorithmic problem-solving, and scalable system design.
